# Hardware-Configuration-Simulator
Development of a SWI-Prolog system that models the configuration of hardware devices in a computer, considering restrictions on interrupt lines (IRQs), input/output address ranges, and ports. It includes logic for checking compatibility, allocating resources, and configuring multiple devices while respecting system restrictions.
